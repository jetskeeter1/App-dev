my nineteenth respository

1. Spiderman
- This is the first spiderman movie I have found and came to like watching spiderman. The story is just an ordinarily young nerd named peter parker who got bit by a radio active spider and became the neighboor hood spiderman that uses his powers right after the death of his uncle and continued on to being the better hero for the people and other heroes while suffering on his own hardships.

2. Belle
- It's a very beautiful movie and has in my opinion has the best compose music and song out of any anime movie or any movie there is that I have known from western movies and eastern movies. It is a story of a japanese teenage student girl named suzu who is a very shy girl that has a hard time interacting with other students and father ever since the lost of her mother, but has a close friend. Suzu finds virtual reality where her talents can truly shine among many others where the whole world adore suzu's created character named "belle" that sings to the heart of the people. Later on is when she find the beast who suzu can see that he was in pain and continues to adventure to find out and uncover the beast. Basically a spin off of the beauty and the beast.

3. Drifting home
- A movie about a bunch of kids and a spirit of the building gets isekai'd to another world where there is only the ocean and the apartment building's bizzare phenomenom where it becomes a sailing building that floats... magicaly. The apartment building sails in one direction where the kids are stuck in the middle of nowhere and are doing their best to survive by looting other floating building and with the power of friendship and occasional fights until they can find their way home. Much like belle it is also a beautiful movie with amazing compose musis.
